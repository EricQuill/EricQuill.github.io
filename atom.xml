<p>I don't know, some self-talking i guess, it has been a long time from last people who really listened to us, even close people around us are busy and merely hearing, so let's blog everyday, left something on the Internet and tell the world I was there.</p>
<p>Second day of blogging, that's great, keep up the good work.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Hello world&quot; is amazing world, which is the sign of freedom to me.</p>
<p>I made mistakes one by one after graduated from college, worked as a seller for many years, which is a huge mistake for people like me, we are introvers, not good at speaking. I always want to be a technologist, tried to be a coder at 32, but failed, it's a little late to know a different way of life.</p>
<p>Now I'm still working on sex toy market, and the situation would last for a long time, whatever, like chuan jian guo said, this is life, so keep walking, may be there was another chance in the future.</p>
<p>Good luck buddy.</p>
